Skeleton Based Action Recognition Methods
=============

#### - Skeleton-based action recognition
  - A computer vision task that involves recognizing human actions from a sequence of 3D skeletal joint data
  - The goal of skeleton-based action recognition is to develop algorithms that can understand and classify human actions from skeleton data
  - The gcn-based method (extracting visual features) and the cnn-based method (extracting graph features) are mainly used.

#### - Goals of this repository
  - Many skeleton-based action-recognition-methods implementation/test/customization etc.
